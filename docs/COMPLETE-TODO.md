# Completed Work

## 2026-06-15

- Created the documentation baseline for LinguaServe.
- Reworked `docs/PRD_Lingua.md` with critique, sharper MVP scope, success metrics, risks, and roadmap.
- Created `docs/Technical_Specification.md` with stack, architecture, performance, data model, APIs, AI/RAG, security, and testing guidance.
- Created `docs/TODO.md` with phased implementation from validation and design through frontend, backend, AI, QA, and pilot.
- Created `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` for project and agent context.
- Added `docs/CONTEXT.md` and `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for future agent alignment.
- Updated the technical direction from Next.js to SvelteKit/Svelte 5 after framework review.
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with SvelteKit module boundaries, dependency rules, state rules, performance rules, and review rules.
- Scaffolded the SvelteKit + Svelte 5 + TypeScript frontend with pnpm, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, and adapter-auto.
- Implemented the frontend prototype for phases 1-5:
  - Customer QR menu route with language selection, preferences, menu browsing, item detail, chat answer states, fallback, and feedback.
  - Admin dashboard with overview, menu editor, import review, QR table manager, knowledge base, and analytics.
  - Staff fallback inbox with selected request detail and guest-view link.
- Added 10 realistic dummy restaurant/menu sources with local SVG cover and menu-scan assets.
- Added SvelteKit PWA manifest, local icon, and service worker.
- Added architecture folders under `src/lib/domain`, `src/lib/server`, `src/lib/ui`, and `src/lib/state`.
- Added domain policy tests and Playwright smoke tests.
- Updated `docs/TODO.md` to mark field-only work as skipped/deferred and phases 1-5 prototype work as complete.

## 2026-06-16

- Clarified product direction as one multi-tenant SaaS platform serving many restaurants, not one app per restaurant.
- Updated dummy domain data with organizations, restaurant public hosts, and organization-scoped restaurant lists.
- Revised frontend copy and dashboard surfaces to reduce "AI prototype" feel and emphasize restaurant operations:
  - Platform entry now shows workspace, restaurants, guest QR view, management dashboard, and staff inbox.
  - Dashboard overview now shows organization-scoped restaurant operations and public host routing.
  - QR table manager now selects a restaurant before showing table QR links.
  - Menu, restaurant facts, reports, and staff inbox now show clearer tenant/restaurant context.
- Updated PRD, technical specification, architecture, context, README, and TODO with multi-tenant routing and tenant isolation rules.
